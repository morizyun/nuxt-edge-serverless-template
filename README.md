### Caution

- Libraries that are used only by the server or that are used by both the server and the client should be included in the `dependencies`. To optimize the lambda capacity, make sure that the library used only by the client is included in `dev-dependencies`.
- If you install a `module` for nuxt.js, it must be in a the `dependencies` not `dev-dependencies`
- Auto generated URL `https://*.execute-api.aws-region-name.amazonaws.com/*` will result in a JavaScript error. (routing problem) Please use the Custom Domain
- If you encounter `Cannot GET /` error message, the error log can be founded in the AWS CloudWatch
